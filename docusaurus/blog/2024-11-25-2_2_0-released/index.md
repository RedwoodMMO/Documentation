## Misc changes

[World Data](/docs/features/world-data) and [Persistent Items (3.0 renamed these to Sync Items)](/docs/features/sync-items) now have docs and are officially released!

We did an initial license check of the backend and verified that all dependencies have a license that allows commercial use without needing to disclose source. Many of the licenses do require license discloser/disclaimer, which we'll be adding in the next release. In the meantime, the licenses used by the dependencies include:

  "MIT",
  "Apache-2.0",
  "ISC",
  "BSD-3-Clause",
  "BSD-2-Clause",
  "0BSD",
  "Unlicense",
  "BlueOak-1.0.0",
  "CC-BY-4.0",
  "CC-BY-3.0",
  "CC0-1.0",
  "Python-2.0",
