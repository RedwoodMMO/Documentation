# Getting Started

This Getting Started section is your one-stop guide when you first use Redwood, regardless of which gameplay template your using and if you have full source code access.

If you want to get started with using the Redwood backend, you'll first need to [**register for a license**](https://license.redwoodmmo.com/register).

You can also play one of our live demos that showcase the gameplay templates by downloading a client using a link below:
