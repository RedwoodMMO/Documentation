# Queue

The `queue` provider is a simple FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queuing system. It was designed for RPGs in mind that may have capacity limits to a limited number of servers. This system will let players into the server based on capacity and/or flow rates (i.e. perhaps the server has 100 free spots but only wants 1 player joining per second).

We're still working on documenting this! In the meantime, checkout the **RPG Template** for a full example of how Queuing is used, including sharding.
