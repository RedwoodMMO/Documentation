# Local Provider

`local` is the default game server provider as it provides the easiest mechanism for running games locally without any other dependencies. It's used when you're running with the dev-initiator.

The `local` provider forks a new process on the host machine and runs the below configurable command:

``` bash
../Engine/Binaries/Binaries/Win64/UnrealEditor.exe C:\\Path\\To\\MyGame\\MyGame.uproject -server -port=7777 -SidecarPort=3020
```

This command will run the compiled dedicated `Server` target with the `Development` build configuration with uncooked content. While using uncooked content can be non-ideal in some cases, it works for most development purposes.

We recommend using the `local` provider for quick iteration and testing; you may find using this provider most often during development and use others when you start testing more production-like environments.

:::warning
The `local` provider isn't supported outside of using it alongside with the `dev-initiator`; this is meant to be a development tool and should not be used in any production/staging/demo environment.

## Configuration

You can find all of the default configuration in `RedwoodBackend/config/node/default/realm/instances/default.yaml` under `game-servers.local` variables, but here's an overview of what's available in the [Realm Instance Config](../../configuration/realm-instance-config.md).

- `game-servers.local.unreal.path` is the folder where where the executable to run exists
- `game-servers.local.unreal.executable` is the name of the executable; we separated this from the path variable so you can keep path the same but change the executable to run different build configurations (i.e. `UnrealEditor-Win64-Shipping.exe`)
- `game-servers.local.project` is the full path to the `.uproject` file; you must [customize](../../configuration/overview.md#customization) this to point to your project
- `game-servers.local.arguments` is the string of arguments to pass to the command; this is **in addition** to `-server -port=XXXX -SidecarPort=YYYY` which are non-optional and predetermined by Redwood

### Ports

The port numbers aren't specifically customizable; they are generated by using `sidecar.connection.ports.game` and `sidecar.connection.ports.sidecar` for `-port` and `-SidecarPort` respectively. Multiples of `10` are added to each of these numbers every time a game server is launched (and resets back to `0` when the backend/dev-initiator restarts).

:::info
You can configure this to used a packaged/cooked version of your game by changing the Realm Instance Config `game-servers.local.unreal.path/executable` variables to the appropriate build output and specifying an empty string for `project`. Here is an example of what this might look like:

``` yaml
game-servers:
  local:
    unreal:
      path: "C:\\Path\\To\\MyGame\\builds"
      executable: "MyGameServer.exe"
    project: ""
```
